# Self-Reflection UX ✨🪞

A lightweight psychological micro-intervention for reducing impulsive hate comments — built not with algorithms or AI moderation, but with a moment of self-awareness.

## 🔍 What Is This?
This is a simple, front-end UX demo that simulates a social media posting interface. If a harmful phrase is detected in a typed message, the screen temporarily goes black — reflecting the user’s face (in reality, using the dark screen) — followed by a calming prompt:

> "Do you really want to post this?"

---

## 🧠 Why It Works
- Based on **Self-Awareness Theory** (Duval & Wicklund, 1972)
- People behave more ethically when they are made self-aware (e.g., seeing their own reflection)
- Classic studies show **mirrors reduce cheating, aggression, and impulsive behavior**
- We simulate a moment of reflection with a simple UI interruption

> "Look at your face, and chill."

---

## 🛠 How It Works
- User types a comment
- If a banned word is detected, the screen fades black
- For ~3 seconds, nothing appears — allowing the user to see their reflection
- Then a message appears: "Do you really want to post this?"
- User chooses to post or cancel

No moderation. No bans. No algorithms.  
Just humans — looking at themselves.

>  
> This one asks nothing more than a second of reflection — before a lifetime of regret.
